### Login with GitHub using PHP

Using this package will authenticate users through their GitHub account by checking their public profile which in turn would represent enough to start a session on the website that creates the request. This package uses the [Slim Framework](http://www.slimframework.com/) to read data from requests and configuration parameters.

To get the package clone it or use composer:
```bash
composer require Codepunker\LoginWithGithub
```
